## Experiment 3 - Empirical proof of conjecture

The algorithm in this paper iterates until it finds a solution for a _target_ distribution of amplitudes that is close enough to the actual _target_ given. The fact that this algorithm actually converges is non-trivial, so before implementing the algorithm in Max we made some tests trying to find a case that is unsolvable. For this task, we fixed a maximum acceptable error corresponding to $2\%$ of the energy of the signal to synthesize and ran the algorithm for $10^6$ randomly chosen _target_ distributions of amplitudes, saving the ones that could not be solved in less than $10$ tries. Finally, we tried the algorithm again for the unsolved cases but this time adding a, small enough in magnitude, random vector and saved the ones that could not be solved again in less than $100$ tries. These experiments was made for the cases $n=8,12$ and $16$, and in each case, the result was the same: the set of unsolvable cases after considering the addition of a small random vector is empty.

Before going to the next experiment it is important to mention that the fact this algorithm converges could be explained by certain mathematical properties of the system, e.g. the set of unsolvable (in $\mathbb{R}^n$) cases could have an empty interior. However, we have not been able to prove this fact yet.
