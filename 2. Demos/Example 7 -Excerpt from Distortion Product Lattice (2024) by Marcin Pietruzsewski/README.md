## Example 7 - Excerpt from Distortion Product Lattice (2024) by Marcin Pietruzsewski

Example 7, from Distortion Product Lattice by Marcin Pietruzsewski, features an organ cluster with QDTS resynthesis using qdt.solver. To create the sound, an FFT analysis of a cluster played on the Fokker microtonal organ was computed using a large hop size of 4096 samples. The fundamental frequency of the lowest note was fed to the target pitch, four components were input as the target spectrum, and a carrier of $C=2500$Hz was specified. Then, a downwards glissando on the target fundamental was applied, descending from 225hz to 10hz. The spectrum of the carrier complex therefore rises throughout the section, as the QDTS fundamental descends. In the context of the piece, the cluster of tones in the carrier complex is close in character to the cluster of organ tones, which creates a further play of associations between the instrument and its resynthesis.
