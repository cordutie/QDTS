## Example 1 - The lick

Example 1 consists of the synthesis of a little melody known
popularly as the lick in the key of A. The audio example contains 
the melody synthesized using additive synthesis, the combination of the additive and **QDTS**
synthesis versions, and the **QDTS** synthesis alone for comparison.

For the **QDTS** synthesis, the computations were made using the `qdts.solver` object together with a _carrier_ 
complex of pure tones with C = 2470Hz.
